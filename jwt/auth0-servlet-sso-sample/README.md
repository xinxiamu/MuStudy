## Using Auth0 with Servlets and JSP technology for Single Sign On (SSO) between two websites

This is a companion sample for the [Auth0 Servlet](https://github.com/auth0/auth0-servlet) library.
Please refer to that library and documentation for further information specific to the library itself.

Perhaps the best way to learn how to use this library is to study the [Auth0 Servlet Sample](https://github.com/auth0-samples/auth0-servlet-sample) source code together with its README file. The contents of this sample build upon the Auth0 Servlet Sample.

This Auth0 Servlet SSO Sample uses plain Java Servlet / JSP technology to demonstration Single Sign On (SSO). The sample consists of two demo websites that have been developed to demonstrate the Auth0 SSO capabilities between a main "portal" website and a Partner website that depends on the main "portal" site for SSO authentication.

### Contents

The included demo websites are:

app1.com - main "portal" website

app2.com - partner website

The aim of this solution is to provide a simple, no-frills sample developers can follow to understand the orchestration
required to achieve SSO using Auth0 using Java, without having to also cope with understanding additional libraries or frameworks.

### Setup

Create an [Auth0 Account](https://auth0.com) (if not already done so - free!).


#### From the Auth0 Dashboard

Create an application - for the purposes of this sample - `app1`
This will represent the Portal site

Ensure you add the following to the settings.

Allowed Callback URLs:

```
http://localhost:3099/callback
http://app1.com:3099/callback
```

Ensure you add the following to the settings.

Allowed Logout URLs:

```
http://localhost:3099/logout
http://app1.com:3099/logout
```

Ensure you switch ON the following setting.

`Use Auth0 instead of the IdP to do Single Sign On`



Create an application - for the purposes of this sample - `app2`
This will represent the Partner site

Ensure you add the following to the settings.

Allowed Callback URLs:

```
http://localhost:4000/callback
http://app2.com:4000/callback
```

Ensure you add the following to the settings.

Allowed Logout URLs:

```
http://localhost:4000/logout
http://app2.com:4000/logout
```

Ensure you switch ON the following setting.

`Use Auth0 instead of the IdP to do Single Sign On`


Define a `database connection` and ensure app1 and app2 both reference this `connnection`


Go to `Users` and select `CREATE USER`

Create a user with a username / password of your choosing, and ensure the database connection defined above is
associated with that user.

OPTIONAL: Setup a Social Connection, for example Google, and and ensure app1 and app2 both reference this social connection.


Ok, that's all the Auth0 Dashboard setup done!


#### Update your hosts file

Update your `hosts` file so you can reference the apps by name, rather than localhost / 127.0.0.1

```
127.0.0.1    app1.com
127.0.0.1    app2.com
```
